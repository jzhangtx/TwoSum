# TwoSum

Given an array A and an integer target, find the indices of the two numbers in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

Note: The problem has exactly one solution. Do not use the same element twice.

Example
A: [1, 3, 3, 4]
target: 5
Answer: [0, 3]

Testing
Input Format
The first line contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case, the input has three lines:

An integer ’n’ denoting the length of the array.
n space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.
An integer ‘target’ denoting the target value.
Output Format
For each test case, the output has two space-separated integers ‘i’ and ‘j’ denoting the indices of the array.
